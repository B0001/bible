# Step 1: Install required packages
# First, install the prerequisites: pkg-config, zip, g++, zlib1g-dev, unzip, and python3.
RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y \
        wget \
        pkg-config \
        zip \
        g++ \
        zlib1g-dev \
        unzip \
        python3

# Step 2: Download Bazel
# Next, download the Bazel binary installer named bazel-<version>-installer-linux-x86_64.sh from the Bazel releases page on GitHub.
RUN wget https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/releases/download/0.29.1/bazel-0.29.1-installer-linux-x86_64.sh

# Step 3: Run the installer
# Run the Bazel installer as follows:
RUN chmod +x bazel-0.29.1-installer-linux-x86_64.sh && \
    ./bazel-0.29.1-installer-linux-x86_64.sh --user

# The --user flag installs Bazel to the $HOME/bin directory on your system and sets the .bazelrc path to $HOME/.bazelrc. Use the --help command to see additional installation options.
# Step 4: Set up your environment
# If you ran the Bazel installer with the --user flag as above, the Bazel executable is installed in your $HOME/bin directory. Itâ€™s a good idea to add this directory to your default paths, as follows:
ENV PATH="$PATH:/root/.bazel/bin"

WORKDIR /py3
RUN wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/GoogleContainerTools/distroless/master/experimental/python3/BUILD && \
    touch WORKSPACE
